  <h2>Bio:</h2>
  <div class="bio">
    <p>While proficient in multiple instruments, the double bass is Esperanza Spalding's main "voice" (although she sings beautifully as well) in creating a genre defying blend of jazz, classical, pop, funk, and rock. Her music has earned her 7 Grammy nominations, with 4 wins, all in various jazz categories.</p>
    <p>Esperanza Spalding was born in Oregon on October 18, 1984. Showing prodigious musical talent at a young age, she began playing violin with the Chamber Music Society of Oregon at five years old. She earned scholarships in music through her high school and college years, studying at The Northwest Academy, Portland State University, and Berklee College of Music. Her first album was released in 2006, with 7 more albums released from then until 2021 (see Discographly below). In addition to performing and making music Esperanza has been teaching music since age 20, first at Berklee College of Music and then, since 2017, at Harvard.</p>
